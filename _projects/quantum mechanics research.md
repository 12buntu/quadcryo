<i> Description </i>
<br>
This has been an ongoing project for many months now. I have worked on it actively and inactively over this time, and have made significant progress in linear algebra and working in Hilbert Space. While I know that many topics here will require significantly more reading and problem-solving, it is healthy to create goals along the way, so that is just what I have done. My research goal right now is to understand the spectral theorem and spectral decomposition. 
<br>
I will update this project space when I deem necessary.
