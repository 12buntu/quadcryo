I am a 16 year old high school student who is interested in mathematics. Primary research interests include elementary number theory, algebraic number theory, algebra, and linear algebra, but I am also interested in anything related to generating functions, analysis, and quantum computation/mechanics. I have so far composed 4 expository works, but I am working on several other minor projects when I am not busy with schoolwork.
